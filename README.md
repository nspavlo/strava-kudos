## Description

This project is a browser extension that enhances the Strava experience by adding a "Kudo All" button and highlighting the next and previous kudo buttons. It helps users quickly give kudos to multiple activities without having to click each one individually.

## Features

- **Kudo All Button**: Adds a button to give kudos to all visible activities with a single click.
- **Excludes Own Activities**: Automatically excludes the user's own activities from being kudoed.
- **Rate Limiting**: Ensures that kudos are given at a controlled rate to avoid hitting rate limits.
- **Debug Menu**: Provides a debug menu with options to trigger notifications, highlight kudo buttons, and remove all kudos.
